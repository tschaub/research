ZNP Research
========

This github repository is a collection of markdown documents to gather research 
from the Zero Net Positive Initiative.

Initially we will not have a hierarchy, just a few pages at the root level, but these 
will extend out in to folders as we figure out an appropriate structure.

Eventually this may move to a wiki or something more friendly to non-github users.
