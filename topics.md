Several initial topics emerged from our initial meeting in Costa Rica:

* Naming / definitions - How do we talk about new types of companies in ways that are definitional? 
 
* 'Badges' - a meta-system for companies to identify, measure and share the qualities that they care about.

* 'Guilds' - rethinking career development in the context of networks. 

* Corporate structures - b-corps, flexible purpose corps, l3c, hybrids, coops, pay it forward corporation

* Governance structures - supervotes, kamikaze clauses, planned sunsetting, size limits, contracts to do good

* 'Human capital' / Management innovation - how do we build more conscious individuals? 'super hr', workplace democracy ideas, etc.

* Financing - kickstarter, jobs act, family and friends, control


Some additional sources of inspiration, to explore and organize in to topics:

* [B-Labs](http://benefitcorp.net/about-b-lab) and their work on b-corp and [benefit corporation](http://benefitcorp.net/).

* Valve's [handbook](http://newcdn.flamehaus.com/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf), and their cool structure.

* Semco's workplace democracy innovations, as detailed in [Maverick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_(book)

* Whole food's articulation of values, like the [Declaration of Interdependence](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/core-values/declaration-interdependence).
