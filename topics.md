Several initial topics emerged from our initial meeting in Costa Rica:

* Naming / definitions - How do we talk about new types of companies in ways that are definitional? 
 
* 'Badges' - a meta-system for companies to identify, measure and share the qualities that they care about.

* 'Guilds' - rethinking career development in the context of networks. 

* Corporate structures - b-corps, flexible purpose corps, l3c, hybrids, coops, pay it forward corporation

* Governance structures - supervotes, kamikaze clauses, contracts to do good

* 'Human capital' / Management innovation - how do we build more conscious individuals? 'super hr', workplace democracy ideas, etc.

* Financing - kickstarter, jobs act, family and friends, control
